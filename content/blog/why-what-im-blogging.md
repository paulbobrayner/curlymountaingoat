title: Why & what I'm blogging
description: A bit about why I started this blog.
---
I started this blog for a number of reasons, some selfish and some less so.

## To stay motivated

Making something public can increase your chances of getting it done. And that's one of my aims for this blog, to help keep me accountable to finish building 'sticky', a software platform for health pros and coaches that I'm currently working on.

## Build a community

What better way is there to build an app than getting feedback from the people who'll be using it along the way. Im keen to hear from any health professionals along the way about what would help them in their coaching with clients, tech and non tech related. 

## Educate

Hopefully I can impart some wisdom from my days working with clients. The key topic that I'll be focussing on is behaviour change and helping your clients to stick to actions you set them. 

This was one of the most critically important things for me when used to work as a health coach. If I wasn't an effective coach and couldn't find strategies to help clients adhere to actions and advice then I wouldn't be supporting them as well as I could In getting them results.

Particularly in health, I noticed that coaches, trainers etc would have the best fitness or nutrition method for their clients but maybe wouldn't consider if the client would actually stick to their prescription.

This is exactly what I hope for this blog, to provide clarity, insight, structure and also some general conjecture on how to support our clients better.
