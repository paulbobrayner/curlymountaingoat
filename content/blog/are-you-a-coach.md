title: Are you a coach?
description: Find out if you're a coach

The term 'coach' seems to be relatively new to the UK. From my perspective it seems like coaches or people calling themselves coaches were around for a lot longer in the US.

You might have the image of either a drill sergeant type football coach barking orders at their athletes or a life coach who is enlightened enough about life that they can tell their clients exactly what to do. In reality, being a coach and coaching clients couldn't be any more different.

When I started out as a personal trainer 9 years ago I definitely didn't consider myself a coach. But as the years went by I gained more experience with clients and I worked in more coachy settings (diabetes prevention and nutrition coaching) I definitely started to identify more as a coach.

I actually think it became essential for me to identify more as a coach, the reason being because it helped me to change the way I thought about my role and made me question my methods when working with my clients.

The more I identified as a coach the more I listened, the more I focussed on my clients needs, the more flexible I was when working on solutions for them and the more I thought about their adherence in the long run.

The more I think about it I think that anyone that works with clients are a type of coach, whatever sector they work in. But especially with health professionals. You can decide yourself but here are some reasons why I think you might be a coach:

* You listen to your clients a lot.
* You prescribe actions/habits/tasks to your clients.
* Clients adhering to these actions is important to their success.
* You help and support clients in achieving specific goals.
* Having good relationships with your clients is necessary or important.

I believe that if your role involves even just a couple of these then your are a coach of sorts. 

Like I said before, if you start to acknowledge that you are a coach, the more you’ll be likely to start working on becoming a better coach. And becoming a better coach means that you’ll provide a better service for your clients.
